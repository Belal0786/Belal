## 3. Features Offered

### CPU Power Management
Modern CPUs use various techniques to manage and optimize the power consumption and thermal management. These techniques help balance performance and power efficiency of the system.

### Telemetry
Telemetry refers to the automated collection and transmission of data from remote or inaccessible points to an IT system in a different location for monitoring and analysis. If we consider the CPU power management, telemetry data includes the parameters such as:
- Power consumption
- Temperature
- Voltage
- Frequency
- CPU utilization
- NIC

### Real-Time Data Collection
- **Continuous Monitoring:** Collect real-time data on CPU power consumption, temperature, voltage, and frequency.

### Relevance
Efficient power management is crucial in today's computing environments to reduce energy costs, extend battery life in portable devices, and minimize thermal output. Power manager telemetry provides valuable insights into how power is used and where optimizations can be made.
